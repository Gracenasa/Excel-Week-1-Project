# Sales Data Analysis With Excel

## Overview
In this project, I analyse a dataset from an MNC spanning a period of 1 year to better understand regional and continental performance with an aim of increasing revenue and sales in underperforming regions. The dataset is generally clean and required close to minimal editing.


## Data Ingestion and Cleaning
My dataset is in CSV format and generally clean and ready for analysis. The dataset lacks null values or mixed data types. Thus, I did not perform data cleaning.

## Descriptive statistics
By making use of the **Data Analysis** tool in Excel, I analysed the sales_value column. Here is a breakdown of my results
- **Average Sale Value**: $5,034.83  
- **Median Sale Value**: $5,020.89 (close to mean, suggesting relatively symmetric distribution)  
- **Sales Range**: $9,988.86 (from $6.68 to $9,995.54)  
- **Total Sales Volume**: Over $5 million across all transactions  
- **Standard Deviation**: $2,899.42 (indicating significant variability in transaction values)

I only focused on the sales_value column as it holds a bulk of the problem statement.



## EDA
## Analysis Process  

1. **Data Exploration**:  
   - Examined the structure and completeness of the dataset  
   - Calculated basic statistical measures (mean, median, range, standard deviation)  
   - Identified data distributions and outliers  

2. **Segmentation Analysis**:  
   - Broke down sales by region and channel  
   - Analyzed performance across different customer countries  

## Insights
### 1. Regional Performance  
- **Top Performing Regions**:  
  - North America has the highest number of purchases as well as being the highest revenue earner.
  - Africa has the lowest purchases and revenue.
### 2. Sales Channel Effectiveness  
- **Online** shopping is the most popular channel. However, **Distributors** are responsible for some of the highest-value transactions 
- **In-store**: Consistent mid-range performance  

### 3. Countries with highest revenue and lowest revenue
- China, Russia, Sweden, Philippines and Indonesia have the highest revenue, while Belgium, Gabon, Estonia, Zimbabwe and Hungary have the lowest revenue across all the countries.

## Recommendations  

### 1. Regional Strategy Optimization  
- **Focus on North America**: Continue capitalizing on high-value transactions while expanding customer base  
- **Develop Asia Market**: Target markets such as China and Russia and capitalize on them for growth.
- **Improve Africa Performance**: Collect more data on Africa's market, (i.e. product pricing, consumer purchasing power and local companies) to determine causes behind the overwhelming poor performance

### 2. Channel-Specific Improvements  
- **Enhance Online Sales**: Invest in marketing on digital platforms to reach more individuals 
- **Optimize Distributor Network**: Provide additional support/training to distributors.

### 3. Customer-Centric Initiatives  
- **Loyalty Programs**: For frequent customer countries (China, Indonesia, Brazil)  
- **Localized Marketing**: Tailor approaches to top customer regions  
- **High-Value Customer Focus**: Identify and nurture relationships with customers making large purchases.
